 Wanpipti - Number Game Webapp Development


Scope of Work: Web Development Project for Daily Number Betting Game
Project Overview
The project involves the development of a web-based game where users can sign up, log in, add cash to their wallet via an API connected to a payment gateway, and place bets on chosen numbers. The game will run three times daily at 2 PM, 5 PM, and 9 PM, with a 10-minute cutoff before each game for placing bets. The backend system will record player information, chosen numbers, and bet amounts, and will determine winners based on input winning numbers. Players can only play for the current day's game, and the next day's game will be available after 12:01 AM.
